# The Wombat Engine

A GNU/Linux Game Engine using Vulkan.

Currently only supports Linux with X server.
Comes with prebuild shared libs.

# How to use.
You can build the shared library using the Cmake and building the project.

To use, link Vulkan, the window system you use (XCB, Wayland, ...) and then, link the engine.
It should work afterward.
